``` python
root = tk.TK()
app = defined_class(root)
root.mainloop()
```

First initialize tkinter with the first line.
Then define the application as an object of a class that defines the app functionality.
Lastly the method "mainloop" will keep continually update the app, allowing for input registration and changes.
